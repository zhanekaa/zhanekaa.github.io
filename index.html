<p> <font size="6">  When objects rotate about some axis-for example, when the CD (compact disc) rotates about its center—each point in the object follows a circular arc. Consider a line from the center of the CD to its edge. Each pit used to record sound along this line moves through the same angle in the same amount of time. 
The rotation angle is the amount of rotation, and is analogous to linear distance. We define the rotation angle Δθ to be the ratio of the arc length to the radius of curvature: 
 </font>   </p>

<p> <center> <font size="8" color="red"> 
            Δθ = Δs/r   </font> </center> </p>

<p> <font size="6"> In mathematics, the angle of rotation (or angular position) is a measurement of the amount (i.e., the angle) that a figure is rotated about a fixed point (often the center of a circle, as shown in). 
<dfn>The arc length Δs </dfn> is the distance traveled along a circular path. r is the radius of curvature of the circular path. </font> </p>


<hr style="border-color: red; border-width: 5px;">


<p> <font size="6"> We know that for one complete revolution, the arc length is the circumference of a circle of radius r. The circumference of a circle is 2πr. 
Thus, for one complete revolution the rotation angle us: </font> </p> 

<p> <center> <font size="8" color="red"> Δθ=(2πr)/r=2π   </font> </center> </p>

<font size="6"> <p> This result is the basis for defining the units used to measure rotation angles to be radians (rad), defined so that:</p> </font> 

<font color="red" size="8"> <center> 2π rad = 1 revolution </center> </font>
 
<p> <font size="6"> If Δθ = 2π rad, then the CD has made one complete revolution, and every point on the CD is back at its original position. Because there are 360º in a circle or one revolution, the relationship between radians and degrees is thus 2π rad=360º, so that:
1rad = 360º/2π = 57.3º. </p> </font>

<font color="red" size="6">
Angular velocity ω is the rate of change of an angle, mathematically defined as </font>

<p> <center> <font size="8" color="red"> ω = Δθ/Δt
  </font> </center> </p>


 <font size="6">where an angular rotation Δθ takes place in a time Δt. The greater the rotation angle in a given amount of time, the greater the angular velocity. The units for angular velocity are radians per second (rad/s).
Angular velocity ω is analogous to linear velocity v. To find the precise relationship between angular and linear velocity, we again consider a pit on the rotating CD. 
This pit moves an arc length Δs in a time Δt, and so it has a linear velocity </font>

<font size="6"> <strong> Note </strong> that the speed of the point at the center of the tire is the same as the speed v of the car. The faster the car moves, the faster the tire spins - large v means a large ω, because v = rω. Similarly, a larger-radius tire rotating at the same angular velocity (ω) will produce a greater linear speed (v) for the car. 

</font> 

<font size="6">

In circular motion, acceleration can occur as the magnitude of the velocity changes. The faster the change occurs, the greater the angular acceleration. 
Angular acceleration is the rate of change of angular velocity, expressed mathematically </font>

How can we calculate rotational inertia in general? </h1> </center> 
<font size="6"> Often mechanical systems are made of many masses connected together, or complex shapes. It is possible to calculate the total rotational inertia for any shape about any axis by summing the rotational inertia of each mass
